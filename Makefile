# Publishing spaghetti to crates.io.
#
# Secret safety: CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN lives only in .env.publish (gitignored).
# It is sourced inside a recipe's own shell subprocess with `. ./.env.publish`
# and never assigned to a Make variable. A Make variable like
# `TOKEN := $(shell cat .env.publish)` would get expanded by Make itself —
# and printed — even under `make -n`, since that substitution happens at
# parse time before the shell ever runs. Keeping it shell-side means `make -n`
# and `make publish` (without CONFIRM=yes) never touch or print it.
